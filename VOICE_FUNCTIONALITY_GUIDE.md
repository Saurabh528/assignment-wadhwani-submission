# Example: Female Friendly character  
voice_key = "Female_Friendly"
mapped_voice = "shimmer"  # Bright, engaging female voice
```

### TTS Manager Methods

- `generate_voiceover(text, character, output_path)` - Generate speech for a character
- `get_voice_style_descriptions()` - Get all available voice styles
- `get_voice_characteristics()` - Get OpenAI voice descriptions
- `get_voice_mapping_info(gender, style)` - Get detailed mapping information

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### Choosing Voice Styles

1. **Educational Content**: Use Professional, Confident, or Technical
2. **Engaging Learners**: Use Friendly, Energetic, or Playful
3. **Complex Topics**: Use Calm or Professional
4. **Storytelling**: Use Narrative or Friendly
5. **Younger Audiences**: Use Playful or Energetic

### Character Voice Design

1. **Consistency**: Keep the same voice style for each character
2. **Personality Match**: Choose voice style that matches character personality
3. **Audience Consideration**: Consider your target audience when selecting voices
4. **Content Type**: Match voice style to content type (technical vs. casual)

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Preview Before Creating**: Always test voice before finalizing character
2. **Compare Options**: Use comparison feature to choose between similar styles
3. **Test with Real Content**: Use actual script text for testing
4. **Check Consistency**: Ensure voice works well across different text lengths

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Use Cases

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Voice not generating**: Check OpenAI API key and internet connection
2. **Wrong voice style**: Verify character's gender and voice style settings
3. **Audio quality issues**: Try different OpenAI voices or quality settings
4. **Preview not working**: Ensure text is not empty and API key is valid

### Performance Tips

1. **Use test mode** for faster preview generation
2. **Keep preview text short** for quicker testing
3. **Cache generated audio** to avoid regenerating same content
4. **Use appropriate quality settings** (standard for testing, HD for production)

## ðŸ“Š Cost Considerations

- **TTS Cost**: $0.015 per 1,000 characters
- **Preview Generation**: Each preview uses API credits
- **Video Generation**: All character dialogue is synthesized
- **Testing**: Multiple tests will increase costs

**Recommendation**: Use test mode and short previews during development to minimize costs.
