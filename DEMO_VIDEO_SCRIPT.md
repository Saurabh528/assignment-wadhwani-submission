## üìã **Demo Structure**

### **üéØ Section 1: Introduction & Architecture (2 minutes)**

**[Screen: Project Overview]**

> "Hello! I'm presenting the AI Content Factory - a complete pipeline that transforms any educational topic into professional video content using AI agents and character-based storytelling."

**[Show architecture diagram]**

> "The system consists of four main components:
> 1. Curriculum Agent - breaks topics into structured lessons
> 2. Character Management - creates and manages AI avatars  
> 3. Script & Video Generation - produces split-screen educational videos
> 4. Quality Assurance - validates output automatically"

**[Show technology stack]**

> "Built with Python, OpenAI GPT-4, DALL-E 3, and optimized for Mac with Apple Silicon support."

---

### **üöÄ Section 2: Core Pipeline Demo (8 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Curriculum Generation (2 minutes)**

**[Screen: Streamlit App - Curriculum Tab]**

> "Let's start with a complete walkthrough. I'll input the topic 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence' and generate a structured curriculum."

**[Action: Enter topic and click Generate]**

> "The system uses GPT-4 to break this into 3 lessons, each with introduction, main content, and summary. Notice the pedagogically sound structure - each lesson builds on the previous one."

**[Show generated curriculum]**

> "Lesson 1 covers fundamentals, Lesson 2 dives into machine learning, and Lesson 3 explores real-world applications. This provides a complete learning journey."

#### **2.2 Character Creation (2 minutes)**

**[Screen: Characters Tab]**

> "Now I'll create an AI professor to teach these lessons. The system generates both the character persona and visual avatar."

**[Action: Fill character form]**
- Name: "Dr. AI Robinson"
- Description: "Professional computer science professor with glasses, wearing a navy blazer, friendly smile, looking directly at camera"
- Voice: Professional, Male

**[Action: Enable avatar generation and submit]**

> "With test mode enabled, this generates a cost-effective avatar using DALL-E 3. In production mode, we'd get higher quality. The system automatically stores the character in our SQLite database."

**[Show generated avatar in character library]**

> "Perfect! Dr. Robinson is now available with avatar ready. Notice the checkmark indicating successful avatar generation."

#### **2.3 Script Generation & Video Production (4 minutes)**

**[Screen: Generate Tab]**

**[Action: Select character and enable avatar videos]**

> "I'll select Dr. Robinson and enable split-screen avatar videos. This creates a layout with the talking professor on the left and educational content on the right."

**[Show sidebar settings]**

> "I'm using static avatars for speed, but SadTalker lip-sync is available for realistic mouth movement. Let me start generation with test assets to demonstrate the pipeline."

**[Action: Click 'Test with Dummy Assets']**

> "Watch the progress bar - it's processing each lesson sequentially:
> 1. Generating character dialogue for each scene
> 2. Creating educational visuals with DALL-E 3  
> 3. Synthesizing speech with character-appropriate voice
> 4. Compositing split-screen videos"

**[Show video generation progress]**

> "This typically takes 2-3 minutes per lesson. The system creates 4-6 scenes per lesson, each with synchronized audio-visual content."

**[Show completed videos]**

> "Excellent! Here are our generated videos. Notice the professional split-screen layout - Dr. Robinson appears to be teaching while educational diagrams appear alongside."

**[Play video sample]**

> "The audio is perfectly synchronized, the educational content matches the narration, and Dr. Robinson maintains consistent appearance across all videos."

---

### **üîç Section 3: Quality Assurance Demo (3 minutes)**

**[Screen: QA Report Tab]**

> "The system includes comprehensive quality assurance. Let me run QA checks on our generated videos."

**[Action: Click 'Run QA Checks']**

> "The QA agent analyzes multiple dimensions:
> - Audio synchronization using ffprobe analysis
> - Character consistency with computer vision
> - Caption alignment and timing
> - Technical metrics like resolution, bitrate, and frame quality"

**[Show QA results]**

> "Excellent scores across all metrics! Audio sync at 94%, character consistency at 91%, and caption alignment at 96%. The system automatically flagged one minor issue - let me show you the detailed analysis."

**[Show detailed QA report]**

> "The detailed report shows frame-by-frame analysis, audio quality metrics, and cross-video consistency checks. In production, this would trigger automatic corrections for any issues below threshold."

---

### **‚ö° Section 4: API Integration & Backend (4 minutes)**

**[Screen: Terminal/API Documentation]**

> "Behind the UI is a complete FastAPI backend with REST endpoints. Let me demonstrate the API integration."

**[Action: Show API docs at localhost:8000/docs]**

> "The API provides endpoints for curriculum generation, character management, video creation, and QA monitoring. This enables integration with other systems or building custom frontends."

**[Action: Make API call to create character]**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/characters" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Professor Smith", "description": "Math teacher", "voice_style": "Professional", "gender": "Female", "generate_avatar": true}'
```

> "The API returns the complete character profile including the generated avatar path. Background tasks handle long-running operations like video generation."

**[Show job status endpoint]**

> "Job management allows tracking video generation progress in real-time, essential for production deployments where videos may take several minutes to generate."

### **‚ú® Section 5: Advanced Features (3 minutes)**

#### **5.1 SadTalker Lip-Sync (1 minute)**

**[Screen: Avatar settings]**

> "For even more realism, the system integrates SadTalker for accurate lip-sync animation. This is optimized for Mac with Metal Performance Shaders support."

**[Show comparison: static vs lip-sync]**

> "Compare the static avatar with SadTalker lip-sync - notice the natural mouth movements synchronized perfectly with the speech. This creates incredibly engaging educational content."

#### **5.2 Multi-language Support (1 minute)**

**[Screen: Language settings]**

> "The system supports multiple languages with appropriate TTS voices. Here's the same curriculum generated in Spanish with culturally appropriate content modifications."

**[Show Spanish interface/content]**

> "Notice how the system maintains educational quality while adapting to different languages and cultural contexts."

#### **5.3 Mac Optimization (1 minute)**

**[Screen: System performance]**

> "The entire system is optimized for Mac development - Apple Silicon support with Metal acceleration, automated setup scripts, and Intel Mac fallback support."

**[Show performance metrics]**

> "On this M2 MacBook, avatar generation takes 30-45 seconds, video processing runs at 2-3 minutes per lesson, and the system efficiently uses available memory and processing power."
